# Common Data Structures and Algorithms Using Python

## Goal
The goal is to gather most of the popular and common data structures and 
algorithms in one  repository. And for consistency in terms of coding style, 
I will be coding all the files myself. Note that I'm only a Computer Science 
student, and I'm coding these, as I'm learning them. I'm studying "Data 
Structures and Algorithms in Python" by Michael T. Goodrich et al. to write these.

## Naming System
The first part of each file's name will be the algorithm or the data structure's
name, and after that will be the implementation method (if there are multiple).
Since I will be coding two variations of each file, one basic and simple version,
and another one with more added features by me, files are going to be specified 
with either (Basic) or (Added Features) in the filename.

## Final Words
For now, I'm only going to work on the basic variations, and after I'm finished
I will work on Added Features on my free time. If you see any issues with an 
implementation, let me know or send a pull request.
