# Common Data Structures and Algorithms Using Python

This is going to be an open source library for common data structures and algorithms.
Everything will be written using Python. I might decide to create two versions of each data structure and algorithm,
one would be the clean version, and one would be with some added features by myself.
But for now I will only work on the basic version of each.

If you find any problem in any of the solutions, or you think I should add a data structure or an algorithm,
please let me know through an email, or just send a pull request.
