# Common Data Structures and Algorithms Using Python

This is going to be an open source library for common data structures and algorithms.
Everything will be written using Python. I might decide to create two versions of each data structure and algorithm,
one would be the basic version, and one would be with some added features by myself.
But for now I will only work on the basic version of each. Note that the basic version will NOT include exception
handling or input checks. As in the name, they will be the most basic version of that particular algorithm or
data structure's implementation.

I'm merely a Computer Science student, and I'm going to write my code whilst studying professor Michael T. Goodrich's book.
If you find any problems in any of the solutions, or you think I should add a data structure or an algorithm,
please let me know through an email, or just send a pull request.
